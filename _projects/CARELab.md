As a graduate researcher at the **CARE Lab** (Control for Assistive and Rehabilitation Robotics Lab) at San Francisco State University, I lead two parallel efforts centered on a Universal Robots UR3e collaborative robot arm: developing a hands-on lab curriculum for undergraduate robotics education, and building out the robot's automation and control capabilities for research applications.

This work was presented as a work-in-progress paper at the **2026 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition**, titled *"MATLAB/Simulink-Based Open-Source Robot Control Framework for Undergraduate Robotics Curriculum."*

### Robotics Lab Curriculum Development

Designed and authored a four-module laboratory curriculum that uses MATLAB and the Real Time Data Exchange (RTDE) protocol to give undergraduate students direct, hands-on control of an industrial UR3e robot — without requiring Linux or ROS. The curriculum progressively builds from installation and safety through teach pendant operation, forward kinematics derivation via screw theory, and a capstone pick-and-place exercise.

### UR3e Automation & Control

Developing the UR3e's automation and control stack for research applications, including ROS2 integration, digital I/O configuration, conveyor belt integration, and custom control pipelines.
