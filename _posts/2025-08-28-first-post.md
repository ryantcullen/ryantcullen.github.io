title: First Post

This is my first blog post. Ever. Not just on this site; of all time! This is truly a momentous occasion. What do I do with my hands? I guess I keep typing about stuff. Or maybe even about things! What is the difference between stuff and things, anyway? Things seem to be countable, while stuff could be a bit more abstract. The stuff of greatness. A collection of things. Either way, I'm going to write about em'!

If you are still reading, I applaud your curiosity, and perhaps question your sanity. Welcome to my blog! I hope you enjoy your stay.
