Hi, I'm Ryan Cullen. I'm an engineer who loves to learn and build and break stuff. Here you can find the results of my various projects and musings.

This site hosts my portfolio and blog. Check out my latest work on the **Projects** page and my thoughts on any number of topics on the **Blog**.

If you'd like to contact me, please email at ryantcullen5@gmail.com.
